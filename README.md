## Important Notes

> **Note:** The extended period between commits was due to persistent connection issues on Aston Walsh's end, which necessitated local development, combined with workload from other assignments and commitments.

> **Note:** While GitHub contribution history shows two primary contributors, all three team members actively contributed to the project. Omar Alkilani's work was completed via a fork and his code was subsequently modified, simplified (due to limited time constraints), and integrated into the main project by Aston Walsh.

> **Note:** The current OpenAI API key has been removed from the repository for security purposes (committing the key to a repo results in it being revoked), this will prevent you from running the ai generation correctly. It is however still present in the zipped canvas submission.
